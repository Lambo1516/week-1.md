  - at 21:06, the for loops and adding new items on vscode is what i have seen before using java to do multiple projects or even on some problem-solving questions. <img width="1680" alt="Screenshot 2023-08-30 at 1 12 00 PM" src="https://github.com/Lambo1516/week-1.md/assets/126631900/e8df3e02-b3b3-47e8-8b12-a605cb7a3587">

- at 23:38, I am confused on what is going on, i can read some of the code but most of it but going over my head. <img width="868" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-15 at 1 26 02 PM" src="https://github.com/Lambo1516/week-1.md/assets/126631900/625fe4cf-aa3f-46a4-85ab-4bd52101c25d">

Q9.) ## You just wrote responses to these questions in Markdown. What even is that? (insert meme here :p). What is Markdown and how is it similar, different, or related to HTML?
- Markdown is used for mainly text and is a way to format it so it looks clean when it comes to reading the text itself, where as HTML is a whole langaue used in web development but with markdown, you can convert them to HTML, which could help you read it easily. ![iy3gwookrno51](https://github.com/Lambo1516/week-1.md/assets/126631900/1f37e7f9-973a-4b6d-ae2d-a3cfd3513ac0)

Q10.) ## What are 3 things you CAN NOT do in markdown that you CAN do in HTML?
- Markdown is mainly for reading while HTML can be used to style and vizualize.
- Markdown lacks the size feature where as HTML is able to change the size of an image according to the developer.
- Markdown lacks customizing features that are available in HTML.
